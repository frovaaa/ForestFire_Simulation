# Notes
- Grid
- Each cell represents a portion of the forest:
  - Unburned
  - Burning
  - Burned
- If adjacent to a burning and unburned: Can ignite with prob `p`
- If unburned can ignite spontaneously with small prob `p_start`
- Bayes:
  - Likelihood of igniting by neighbor = P (Si(t + 1) = burning|Si_neighbors (t) = burning) = p
  - Lieklihood of igniting spontaneous = P (Si(t + 1) = burning) = p_start
- A burning cell transitions into a burned cell in the next time step.
- Burned and unburned cells retain their states unless altered by the above conditions.


# Design the pseudocode for the forest fire model:
## A. Design the initialize_grid function

Develop pseudocode for the initialize grid
function that outputs a m Ã— n grid, where each point represents a portion of the forest. Your map
should include at least one water body (Water), a few patches of dry grass (DryGrass), areas with
dense trees (DenseTrees), and a few initially burning areas (Burning). Label the rest of the areas
as NormalForest. This grid will represent the initial state of the forest before the fire simulation
begins.

```{r}
cell_states <- c(
  "Water",        #1
  "DryGrass",     #2
  "DenseTrees",   #3
  "Burning",      #4
  "NormalForest"  #5
)

# Initialize grif function
initialize_grid <- function(rows, cols) {
  grid <- matrix(nrow = rows, ncol = cols)
  for (y in 1:rows){
    for (x in 1:cols) {
      # Sample from the indexes of the cell_States dictionary
      grid[y, x] <- sample(seq_along(cell_states), 1)
    }
  }

  return (grid)
}

initial_state <- initialize_grid(5,5)
initial_state_labels <- sapply(initial_state, function(val) cell_states[val])


```
